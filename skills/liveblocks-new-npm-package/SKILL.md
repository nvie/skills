  Publish a new placeholder package to NPM under the @liveblocks/* org.
  Creates a minimal package.json + index.js in a temp dir and gives the

# Publish a new @liveblocks/\* NPM placeholder

The goal is to claim a new package name on NPM by publishing a minimal `0.0.0`
placeholder. The user then fills it in for real later.

## Template

The minimal package has exactly two files:

**`package.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "@liveblocks/<PACKAGE>",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

**`index.js`**

```js
// Placeholder
```

No `README.md`, no `description`, no extra fields.

## Process

1. **Ask the user for the package name** if not already provided (e.g. `foobar`
   → full name becomes `@liveblocks/foobar`).

2. **Output a single shell script the user can paste and run:**

```sh
PKG="foobar"   # ← substitute the actual short name

DIR=$(mktemp -d)
mkdir -p "$DIR/@liveblocks/$PKG"
cd "$DIR/@liveblocks/$PKG"

cat > package.json <<'EOF'
{
  "name": "@liveblocks/foobar",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "main": "index.js"
}
EOF

echo '// Placeholder' > index.js

npm publish --access public
```

Adapt `PKG` and the `"name"` field to the actual package name the user provided.

3. **Remind the user:**

   - They must be logged in to npm with an account that has publish rights to the
     `@liveblocks` org (`npm whoami` to check, `npm login` if not).
   - After publishing, the temp dir can be deleted.
   - The `--access public` flag is required for scoped packages on the free tier.

4. **Do not** run any of these commands yourself — hand them to the user to execute.
